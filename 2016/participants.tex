\section*{Tim Weenink}
(TimWeenink) 

Hola! My name is Tim and I come from the Netherlands. I did my bachelor in mathematics at the TU Eindhoven and right now I'm spending the semester in Barcelona as an Erasmus student. The part of mathematics that I find most interesting is cryptology. Regarding this course, I hope we get to see some practical applications of the theory we learned in the first part.

\section*{Simon Van den Eynde}
(Simonvde)

Hello! I'm Simon and I'm from Belgium. This is my first year of the master and I'm also doing a semester here as an Erasmus student. At my university I followed some programming courses in which I learned to code Java decently and got an introductory course on C/C++. I also used python-based math packages (mainly Sagemath.org). For this course I don't have a specific thing in mind, but I liked what we did in the first semester and coding a thing or two on polygons would be interesting, for example using CGAL.
